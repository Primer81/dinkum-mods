/// Constants used for GetBlock or GetBlockId calls throughout the engine, to guide whether the block should be read from the solid blocks layer, the fluids layer, or perhaps both.
/// <br />The game engine supports different block layers in 1.17+.  Currently there is a solid blocks layer (e.g. terrain, loose stones, plants, reeds) and a fluid layer (e.g. still water, flowing water, lava, lake ice). Both layers can contain a block at the same position.
/// <br />Use the .Default value for getting blocks in the general case, use the .Solid/.Fluid value to read from the solid blocks or fluid layer specifically
